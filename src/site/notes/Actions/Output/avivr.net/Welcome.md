# üëãüèª Welcome

Hi, I'm Aviv, a data scientist specializing in machine learning and signal processing.

I have tackled data-intensive problems across diverse domains, including cardiology (deep-learning based ECG analysis), computational biology (directional statistics for protein structure analysis), transportation (time-series processing) and quantitative finance (learning-based portfolio construction and optimization).

I completed my PhD in the Technion Computer Science Faculty, where I conducted multidisciplinary research developing ML-based algorithms and statistical tools for real-world applications in medicine and biology under the supervision of Prof. [Alex Bronstein](https://bron.cs.technion.ac.il).
My research has been published in journals and conferences such as Nature Communications, PNAS, ICLR, and ICML. I was also the head TA of the faculty's Deep Learning course.

In addition to research, I have a strong background in software engineering from multiple technical roles, where I gained extensive experience creating robust, testable, well-designed software.
